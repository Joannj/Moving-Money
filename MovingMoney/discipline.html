        <p><b>How to discipline yourself?</b><br>
        <br> Constantly remind yourself why you are saving your money. Continuosly tell yourself that I'm going
         to get the same item have, but the difference between us is that I wont be paying my item for 2 years after
          it is no longer a trend.<br>
        <br>Even when we are saving money, we need still want to spoil ourself abit, because we all work hard for our 
            salaries and want to be rewarded at the end of the month. Here's a few tips on how to reward yourself using less money:<br>
	        Watch matinee movies instead of higher-priced evening showings.<br>
            Eat out once or twice a month rather than once or twice a week.<br>
	        Make your own coffee and take it to work or school rather than stopping by a 	coffee stand on your way.<br>
        <br>Find a suitable punishment if goals are not met. If you went over your entertainment budget for the current month, 
            it needs to be deducted from next months entertainment budget.<br>
