                <p><b>Are you tired of getting paid just to be broke 3 days after?</b><br>
                <br>
                Tired of everyone telling you to save but not showing you how? Well.... We at Moving Money know the struggles of being paid
                 minimum wage but still having to make it through the month to the next pay day! Saving and Investments sites are always using 
                 financial terms to describe how to save money and that's when I stop paying attention and end up spending it all.<br>
                <br>
                We got someone patient enough to sit down and explain how to save our money, in simple english. Check out the money saving tips
                 below and start Moving you Money Urban Style! Be sure to head over to the simple savings calculator to see how much money you are
                  currently throwing away. With a slight life style change and a couple of tweeks and pinches, you too can live the life people dare
                  to dream of.<br>
